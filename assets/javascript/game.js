//Pseudocode:
//Super Smash Bros RPG!
//Game starts, page is loaded including 4 characters to choose from 
//Each character has health, and an attack power all within a character card div
//Each div listens for clicks. When clicked, the person clicked should move to the "Your Character" section
//The remaining 3 divs are moved to the "Enemies Available To Attack" section and their background goes to red
//When one of the characters in the Available to attack section is clicked, They move to the "Defender" section and background goes to black
//When attack is clicked, your attack triggers at a given number. Every attack, that number is doubled
//At the same time, the enemy attacks you for a set ammt that does not increase
//If your character health < 0, you lose, it says you are defeated, clicking attack does not work and a restart bottun pops
//Clicking restart button reloads the page
//if the defender's health drops below 0, it tells me I have defeated Luke and I can choose another enemy
//If there is no enemy in the defender box, and you click attack, game tells you to choose another enemy
//When the next character is picked, they move to defender and same cycle occurs, but the attack is still incrementing by 8
//If you kill every team member, the game alerts you that you have won and makes it game over

//Remember! You can give an image an attribute that it carries - can be a number or value later accessed
